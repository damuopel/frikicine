WandaVision introduces the next pseudo-scientific explanation for super-powers in the MCU - cosmic energy. In theory, the Marvel Cinematic Universe is built on a scientific foundation. When Marvel introduced magic in Doctor Strange, for example, they took care to consult with a range of scientists on everything from quantum mechanics to string theory in order to ensure their version of magic fit in a world of super-soldiers and exo-armored Avengers.
